like many other "seq" analysis single cell rna-seq (ScRNA-seq) analysis also begins with a quality check on the initial data. Low quality libraries (cell) in a ScRNA-seq can srise from a veriety of sources.
Such as,
1. Cell damage during dissociation.
2. Failure in library preparation (inefficient reverse transcription or PCR amplification)
3. Inclusion of libraries with "low count" e.g., lot of cells with few expressed genes and high 'mitochondial' and 'spike-in' proportion
