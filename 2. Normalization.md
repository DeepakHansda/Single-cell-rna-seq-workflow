More Often than not there is a systematic diffrence in sequencing coverage between libraries. They typically arise from technical differences in cDNA capture or PCR amplification efficiency across cells, and due to the difficulty of achieving consistent library preparation with minimal starting material. To remove these differences, Normalization is done. It aims to removes these differences such that they do not interfere with the comparison between expression profiles of cells. This ensures that the observed heterogeniety or diffrences in expression profiles is due to Biology and not because of the technical biases.
