To interpret our clustering results, we need to identify the genes that drive separation between clusters. These marker genes allow us to assign biological meaning to each cluster based on their functional annotation. In the simplest case, we have _a priori_ knowledge of the marker genes associated with particular cell types, allowing us to treat the clustering as a _proxy_ for cell type identity. The most straightforward approach to marker gene detection involves testing for differential expression between clusters. If a gene is strongly DE between clusters, it is likely to have driven the separation of cells in the clustering algorithm. Like many a times we will use 10X PBMC data set.
