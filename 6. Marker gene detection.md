To interpret our clustering results, we need to identify the genes that drive separation between clusters. These marker genes allow us to assign biological meaning to each cluster based on their functional annotation. In the simplest case, we have _a priori_ knowledge of the marker genes associated with particular cell types, allowing us to treat the clustering as a _proxy_ for cell type identity. The most straightforward approach to marker gene detection involves testing for differential expression between clusters. If a gene is strongly DE between clusters, it is likely to have driven the separation of cells in the clustering algorithm. Like many a times we will use 10X PBMC data set. 

```r
# loading the raw data from 10x PBMC data base 

library(DropletTestFiles)
library(DropletUtils)

### Scoring markers by pairwise comparison

Our general strategy is to compare each pair of clusters (like shown in the following figure) and compute scores quantifying the differences in the expression distributions between clusters. 

![expression distribution comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85447250/212570300-9e777688-69af-4c17-a95a-7469207e959b.jpg)

Fig. Schematic showing the pairwise comparison of expression distribution for `cluster1` with other `clustres`. 

The scores for all pairwise comparisons involving a particular cluster are then consolidated into a single DataFrame for that cluster. The scoreMarkers() function from scran returns a list of DataFrames where each DataFrame corresponds to a cluster and each row of the DataFrame corresponds to a gene. In the DataFrame for cluster X, the columns contain the `self.average`, the mean log-expression in X; `other.average`, the grand mean across all other clusters; `self.detected`, the proportion of cells with detected expression in X; `other.detected`, the mean detected proportion across all other clusters; and finally, a variety of effect size summaries generated from all pairwise comparisons involving X.

```r
# So we have 16 clusters from previous steps; look above

### Effect sizes for pairwise comparisons

First of all why do we have to use and measure `effect size` for a comparison of two population? To put in simply it is used to figure out how diffrent two populations are w.r.t each other (here, for example we have two populations; one for age group 6-7 and one for age group 15-17. and we are interested in knowing how different the average height of one population group is w.r.t other. effect size is typiclly calculated when we are interested not only in "if the means are significantly different" (p-value), but also by how much. we will look at few of effect sizes.  

+ AUC: In the context of marker detection previously, we have mentioned the area under the curve (AUC) which quantifies our ability to distinguish between two distributions in a pairwise comparison. The AUC represents the probability that a randomly chosen observation from our cluster of interest is greater than a randomly chosen observation from the other cluster. A value of 1 corresponds to upregulation, where all values of our cluster of interest are greater than any value from the other cluster; a value of 0.5 means that there is no net difference in the location of the distributions; and a value of 0 corresponds to downregulation. The AUC is closely related to the U statistic in the Wilcoxon ranked sum test (a.k.a., Mann-Whitney U-test).

+ Cohen's _d_: 


```math

d = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{S_p}
```

where, 

M<sub>1</sub> = sample mean of group 1 

M<sub>2</sub> = sample mean of group 2 

S<sub>p</sub> = pooled estimated population standard deviation 

Cohen’s d is a standardized log-fold change where the difference in the mean log-expression between groups is scaled by the average standard deviation across groups. In other words, it is the number of standard deviations that separate the means of the two groups. The interpretation is similar to the log-fold change; positive values indicate that the gene is upregulated in our cluster of interest, negative values indicate downregulation and values close to zero indicate that there is little difference. Cohen’s d is roughly analogous to the t-statistic in various two-sample t-tests.

+ Finally, we also compute the log-fold change in the proportion of cells with detected expression between clusters. This ignores any information about the magnitude of expression, only considering whether any expression is detected at all. Again, positive values indicate that a greater proportion of cells express the gene in our cluster of interest compared to the other cluster. Note that a pseudo-count is added to avoid undefined log-fold changes when no cells express the gene in either group.

The AUC or Cohen’s d is usually the best choice for general purpose marker detection, as they are effective regardless of the magnitude of the expression values. The log-fold change in the detected proportion is specifically useful for identifying binary changes in expression.

### Summarizing pairwise size effects

In a dataset with N clusters, every type of effect size in a cluster is the result of interaction/comparison/association with the rest of N-1 clusters. To simplify interpretation, we summarize the effects for each cluster into some key statistics such as the mean and median. Each summary statistic has a different interpretation when used for ranking.

+ The most obvious summary statistic is the mean. For cluster X, a large mean effect size (>0 for the log-fold changes, >0.5 for the AUCs) indicates that the gene is upregulated in X compared to the average of the other groups.
+ Another summary statistic is the median, where a large value indicates that the gene is upregulated in X compared to most (>50%) other clusters. The median provides greater robustness to outliers than the mean, which may or may not be desirable. On one hand, the median avoids an inflated effect size if only a minority of comparisons have large effects; on the other hand, it will also overstate the effect size by ignoring a minority of comparisons that have opposing effects.
+ The minimum value (min.\*) is the most stringent summary for identifying upregulated genes, as a large value indicates that the gene is upregulated in X compared to all other clusters. Conversely, if the minimum is small (<0 for the log-fold changes, <0.5 for the AUCs), we can conclude that the gene is downregulated in X compared to at least one other cluster.
+ The maximum value (max.\*) is the least stringent summary for identifying upregulated genes, as a large value can be obtained if there is strong upregulation in X compared to any other cluster. Conversely, if the maximum is small, we can conclude that the gene is downregulated in X compared to all other clusters.
+ The minimum rank, a.k.a., “min-rank” (rank.\*) is the smallest rank of each gene across all pairwise comparisons. Specifically, genes are ranked within each pairwise comparison based on decreasing effect size, and then the smallest rank across all comparisons is reported for each gene. If a gene has a small min-rank, we can conclude that it is one of the top upregulated genes in at least one comparison of X to another cluster.

Each of these summaries is computed for each effect size, for each gene, and for each cluster. Our next step is to choose one of these summary statistics for one of the effect sizes and to use it to rank the rows of the `DataFrame`. The mean and median are usually the reasonable defaults for most applications. For example we will use median Cohen’s d to obtain a ranking of upregulated markers for cluster 5.

```r
chosen <- marker.info[["5"]]
ordered <- chosen[order(chosen$median.logFC.cohen,decreasing=TRUE),]

Fig. Distribution of expression values across clusters for the top potential marker genes (as determined by the median Cohen’s d) for cluster 5 in the PBMC dataset.

We can use `min.rank` (by setting T value) as a reliable size effect to get top T genes which certainly can distinguish our cluster of interest from  any  other clusters. For example, we take T=5 in the following example for cluster 5. So, this excercise will ensure that our set of top potential marker genes contains atleast T genes which can distinguish cluster 5 from any other clusters. We use largets Cohen's _d_.

```r
ordered <- chosen[order(chosen$rank.logFC.cohen),]
top.ranked <- ordered[ordered$rank.logFC.cohen <= 5,]

Fig. Heatmap of the centered average log-expression values for the top potential marker genes for cluster 5 in the PBMC dataset. The set of markers was selected as those genes with Cohen’s d-derived min-ranks less than or equal to 5. one coordinate axis displays cells groups while other displays potential top marker genes.

**explanation**

`plotGroupedHeatmap()` will create a heatmap of average expression values for each group of cells and specified features in a  `SingleCellExperiment` object. `sce.pbmc` is an SCE object. `features=` a character vector of row (genes) names, a logical vector, or integer vector of indices specifying rows of object to visualize. `group=` string specifying the field of colData(object) containing the grouping factor, e.g., cell types or clusters ("leble" here; each cell has a lable). `center=` a logical scalar indicating whether each feature should have its mean expression centered at zero prior to plotting. `zlim=` a numeric vector of length 2, specifying the upper and lower bounds for color mapping of expression values. 

**end of explanation**

### Obtaining the full size effects

Some time we need to investigate some specific comparison; say we want to identify the genes that distinguish cluster 5 from other clusters with high XYZ expression.To do so, we set `full.stats=TRUE` to obtain the effect sizes for all pairwise comparisons involving a particular cluster (cluster 5 here). This is returned in the form of a nested DataFrame for each effect size type (extra full.* column is returned in the DataFrame). This contains a nested DataFrame with number of columns equal to the number of other groups (15 here). Each column contains the statistic from the comparison between the cluster in question (cluster 5) and the other clusters. `full.AUC` contains the AUCs for the comparisons between cluster 5 and every other cluster.

Now, suppose we want to identify the genes that distinguish cluster 5 from other clusters with high NKG7 expression. First we need to subset cluster 5 for the gene of interest (NKG7).To illustrate, we use the smallest rank from `computeMinRank()` to identify the top DE genes in cluster 4 compared to the other NKG7-high clusters. For each gene, the minimum rank, a.k.a., “min-rank” (top rank) is defined by ranking values within each column of `chosen` (matrix of statistics formed due to multiple differential comparisons (columns; each column of `chosen` represent the comparison of cluster 5 with any other particular cluster. That's why we do have 15 columns in `chosen` ) and genes (rows)), and then taking the minimum rank value across columns. 

```r
# step 1; identifying cluster with high NKG7 expression; we can look at previous plot
nkg7.high <- c("5", "11", "8", "13")

# step 2 making subset of those high NKG7 clusters
subset <- chosen$full.AUC[,colnames(chosen$full.AUC) %in% nkg7.high]

# computing "min.rank" for each gene and retaining the genes which have "min.rank" <= 10 (i.e. top ten genes)
to.show <- subset[computeMinRank(subset) <= 10,]

plotGroupedHeatmap(sce.pbmc[,colLabels(sce.pbmc) %in% nkg7.high],
                   features=rownames(to.show), group="label", center=TRUE, 
                   zlim=c(-3, 3))
```
