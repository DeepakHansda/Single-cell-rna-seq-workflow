Several downstream processes, like characterizing heterogeniety in an exploratory analysis, we need `genes` which are differentially expressed between any two cells. So, the process of selecting such `genes` which may tell about different existing "cell groups" within a population is called Feature selection and the group of `genes` which help us doing this are called `HVGs` (Highly variable genes). We will proceed with a 10X PBMC data set.
